## Features
- **User Registration**: The system validates email/username and password inputs, storing user credentials securely in a file.
- **User Login**: User credentials are verified against stored data, granting access upon successful validation.
- **Forgotten Password Retrieval**: Users can retrieve passwords by providing their username.

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Usage
1. Run the ipynb file: `Registration_&_Login_System.ipynb`
2. Choose between registration or login.
3. Enter your email/username and password as prompted.
   - For registration, valid inputs are stored securely after validation.
   - For login, credentials are cross-checked against stored data.

## Workflow
**Stage 1: Registration**
- Validate email/username:
   - Must contain "@" followed by a "."
   - Cannot have "." immediately after "@"
   - Should not start with special characters or numbers
- Validate password:
   - Must be between 5 and 16 characters
   - Requires at least one special character, digit, uppercase, and lowercase character

**Stage 2: Data Storage**
- Validated username and password securely stored in a file.

**Stage 3: Login**
- Validate user-provided username and password against stored data.
   - If credentials do not exist, prompt the user to register.
   - If "forgot password" is chosen, retrieve the original password based on username (if in file) and allow the user to set a new password.
   - If no match is found, guide the user to register.

## Tools & Skills
- **Python Programming**: Developed the entire system using Python.
- **File Handling**: Implemented secure data storage and retrieval using file handling techniques.
- **Data Validation**: Ensured user inputs met specific criteria for registration and login.
